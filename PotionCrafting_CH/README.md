## Cube crafting using potions for D2RMM
<a name="h01" />

**Warning: Being able to to craft pretty much any equipment - runeword base, charm or unique - can take the fun out of the game.**

This mod adds recipes for more item crafting using the Horadric cube.
We may not have Chaos Orbs, Orbs of Scouring and the like, but we do have... potions.

These recipes use potions (and occasionally scrolls) to mark what actions to take.
In general, Thawing potions loosen things up to take them apart, while Antidote potions make things better,
and Stamina potions are for recipes where you are likely to want to keep on going. :)

For items, sockets can be added or removed, socket-fillers can be extracted, basic items can be upgraded to exceptional or elite. And more.

There are recipes to get the effect of rerolling charms, rings, amulets and jewels.

There are also recipes for upgrading and converting potions, which could really be considered "potion crafting".

Note that the "Breakpoint and Recipe UI Panels" mod must install before this mod for recipes to be added to UI Panel.

## Rerolling items
<a name="h02" />

If __`Convert to normal item`__ is enabled, then recipes are added to convert Unique/Set/Rare/Magic/Superior items to Normal items,
or Low Quality -> Normal -> Superior.

- The recipe is: item + Antidote potion + Stamina Potion.

If __`Upgrade item`__ is enabled, then recipes are added to:

- Upgrade to Exceptional or Elite: item + Antidote Potion + Identify Scroll.
- Upgrade to Ethereal: item + Antidote Potion + Stamina Potion + Thawing Potion.
- Repair: item + Antidote Potion + Thawing Potion.

If __`Reroll item`__ is enabled, then recipes are added to reroll an item.

- The base reroll recipe is: item + Stamina Potion + Identify Scroll.
- The recipe: item + Stamina Potion + Identify Scroll + Full Rejuvination Potion rerolls at high item level.
- The recipe: item + Antidote Potion + Stamina Potion + Identify Scroll converts Normal/Superior -> Magic -> Rare.
- The recipe: item + Antidote Potion + Identify Tome converts to a Set item.
If the item is inappropriate or not high enough ilvl, it will become a failed set item.
Items from the Cow King's set cannot be made with this recipe.
- The recipe: item + Antidote Potion + Portal Tome converts to a Unique item.
If the item is inappropriate or not high enough ilvl, it will become a failed unique item.
Also, unless __`Fix unique items for crafting`__ is enabled, a given Unique can only appear once per game.
(Charms will obey the "only one in possession" requirement.)

If __`Reroll jewelry`__ is enabled, then the following recipes are added:

- 2 Magic rings -> Magic amulet
- 2 Magic amulets -> Magic ring
- 2 Rare rings -> Rare amulet
- 2 Rare amulets -> Rare ring
- 2 Magic jewels -> Rare jewel
- 2 Rare jewels -> Magic jewel
- 2 Charms -> Charm of same size
- Charm + Antidote Potion + Stamina Portal -> next size of charme
- Amulet + Thawing Potion -> Jewel
- Ring + Thawing Potion -> Small Charm

## Socketing
<a name="h03" />

If __`Toggle sockets`__ is enabled, then recipes are added to toggle sockets in normal and superior items.
This will reroll the item.

- The recipe to toggle sockets on/off is: item + Stamina Potion
- The recipe: item + Stamina Potion + Minor Health Potion tries to set 2 sockets.
- The recipe: item + Stamina Potion + Light Health Potion tries to set 3 sockets.
- The recipe: item + Stamina Potion + (Standard) Health Potion tries to set 4 sockets.
- The recipe: item + Stamina Potion + Greater Health Potion tries to set 5 sockets.
- The recipe: item + Stamina Potion + Super Health Potion tries to set 6 sockets.

If __`Add sockets`__ is enabled, then recipes are added to add sockets to Unique/Set/Rare/Magic items.

- The recipe is item + Antidote Potion + Portal Scroll.

If __`Remove items from sockets`__ is enabled, then recipes are added for weapons and armor to remove items from sockets,
recovering both the item and the socket fillers.

- The recipe is item + Thawing potion.

Since a 2x4 weapon may have up to 6 sockets, unsocketing such an item will require an Expanded Cube mod to have enough space.

The __`Update recipes panel`__ setting is for when the "Breakpoint and Recipe UI Panels" mod is installed.
It updates the recipe panel to include the new recipes added by this mod.
The "Breakpoint and Recipe UI Panels" mod must install before this mod for recipes to be added to UI Panel.

If __`Fix unique items for crafting`__ is enabled, then unique items are allowed to drop more than once per game.
This is useful for being able to reroll the same unique item over and over again. 
Also uniques with a required area level of over 99 (Torch, Annihilus) have that lowered to equal their required level instead.
This allows them to be rerolled (otherwise, they consider the character to not be high level enough for the recipe).
This code is from olegbl's [Horadric Forging mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/229).

## Example: Crafting a Giant Thresher for Infinity
<a name="h05" />

**Warning: Being able to to craft pretty much any equipment - runeword base, charm or unique - can take the fun out of the game.**

To craft a giant thresher for infinity for your mercenary use these steps:

1. Go to Gheed and buy or gamble a War Scythe.
2. If the item is magic or rare, use the Item + Stamina + Antidote recipe to transmute it to normal.
3. Use the Item + Antidote + Identify recipe to upgrade to a Grim Scythe and then to a Giant Thresher.
4. Use the Item + Stamina + Identify + Full Rejuv recipe to upgrade the item to ilvl 99 and to set the level requirement back to the normal value (66 for a Giant Thresher).
5. If you want a superior item, use the Item + Antidote + Stamina recipe to make is superior. Then use the Item + Stamina recipe until you have a superior affix of +15% Enhanced Damage and no sockets.
6. Socket the item: for Infinity, we want 4 sockets, so the recipe is item + Stamina Potion + (Standard) Health Potion. Here are the possible recipes:
    - 2 sockets: Item + Stamina Potion + Minor Health Potion
    - 3 sockets: Item + Stamina Potion + Light Health Potion
    - 4 sockets: Item + Stamina Potion + (Standard) Health Potion
    - 5 sockets: Item + Stamina Potion + Greater Health Potion
    - 6 sockets: Item + Stamina Potion + Super Health Potion
    - To get a Standard Health Potion, use the Health + Thawing recipe to split down from a Super Health potion.
7. If you want the item to be Ethereal, use the item + Antidote Potion + Stamina Potion + Thawing Potion recipe.
