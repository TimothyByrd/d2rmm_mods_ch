# RuneSplitting_CH

## Rune Splitting for D2RMM

This mod adds recipes for upgrading and splitting runes.

If __`2-Rune Upgrades`__ is enabled, the existing rune upgrade recipes are updated to require two of the lower rune and no gem.

If __`Rune Splitting`__ is enabled, 32 recipees are added each taking a single rune Eld through Zod and returning 2 of the lower rune.
Recipes taking a single rune may conflict with the StackableRunes mod. If that mod is also being used,
then set the  __`Require a thawing potion to split`__ option.
