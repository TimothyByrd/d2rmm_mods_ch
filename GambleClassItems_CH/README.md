## Gamble Class-specific Items for D2RMM

This mod makes class-specific items available for gambling.

If __`Amazon`__ is enabled, then Amazon-specific bows, spears & javelins can be gambled.

If __`Assassin`__ is enabled, then Assassin katars can be gambled.
(Though suppoesedly katars are already available for gambling.)

If __`Barbarian`__ is enabled, then Barbarian-specific helmets can be gambled.

If __`Druid`__ is enabled, then Druid-specific pelts can be gambled.

If __`Necromancer`__ is enabled, then Necromancer wands and heads can be gambled.

If __`Paladin`__ is enabled, then Paladin scepters and shields can be gambled.

If __`Sorceress`__ is enabled, then Sorceress staves and orbs can be gambled.

If __`Charms`__ is enabled, then small, medium and large charms can be gambled.

If __`Jewels`__ is enabled, then jewels can be gambled.

If __`Only add normal items`__ is enabled, then only normal items - not exceptional and elite item type - will be added to gamble.txt.
This is the way other items are put into gamble.txt, but may need to be disabled if there is a problem
with the normal -> exceptional -> elite progression for some class-specific item type.

If __`Increase gambling odds`__ is enabled, then the chances of a gamble being rare/set/unique are increased,
as well as the chances of an exceptional or elite upgrade.
