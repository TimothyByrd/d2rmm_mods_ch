## Gamble Class-specific Items for D2RMM

This mod makes class-specific items available for gambling. (Assassin katars can already be gambled.)

If __`Amazon`__ is enabled, then Amazon-specific bows, spears & javelins can be gambled.

If __`Barbarian`__ is enabled, then Barbarian-specific helmets can be gambled.

If __`Druid`__ is enabled, then Druid-specific pelts can be gambled.

If __`Necromancer`__ is enabled, then Necromancer wands and heads can be gambled.

If __`Paladin`__ is enabled, then Paladin scepters and shields can be gambled.

If __`Sorceress`__ is enabled, then Sorceress staves and orbs can be gambled.

If __`Only add normal items`__ is enabled, then only normal items - not exceptional and elite item type - will be added to gamble.txt.
This is the way other items are put into gamble.txt, but may need to be disabled if there is a problem
with the normal -> exceptional -> elite progression for some class-specific item type.

If __`Increase gambling odds`__ is enabled, then the chances of a gamble being rare/set/unique are greatly increased,
as well as the chances of an exceptional or elite upgrade.

- Exclude Axes
- Exclude Bows
