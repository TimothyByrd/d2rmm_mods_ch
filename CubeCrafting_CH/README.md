## Crafting Recipes for D2RMM

This mod adds recipes for more item crafting using the Horadric cube.

If __`Fix unique items for crafting`__ is enabled, then unique items are allowed to drop more than once per game.
This is useful for being able to reroll the same unique item over and over again. 
Also uniques with a required area level of over 99 (Torch, Annihilus) have that lowered to equal their required level instead.
This allows them to be rerolled (otherwise, they consider the character to not be high level enough for the recipe).
This code is from olegbl's [Horadric Forging mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/229).

If __`Remove items from sockets`__ is enabled, then recipes are added for weapons and armor to remove items from sockets,
recovering for the item and the socket fillers.
Since a 2x4 item may have up to 6 sockets, unsocketing such an item will require the ExpandedCube mod to have enough space.
