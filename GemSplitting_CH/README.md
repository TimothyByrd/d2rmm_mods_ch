# GemSplitting_CH

## Gem Splitting for D2RMM

This mod adds recipes for upgrading and splitting gems.

If __`2-Gem Upgrades`__ is enabled, the existing gem upgrade recipes are updated to require two of the lower gem.

If __`Gem Splitting`__ is enabled, 28 recipees are added each taking a single gem of flawed or higher rank and returning 2 gems of one step lower rank.
Recipes taking a single gem may conflict with the StackableGems mod. If that mod is also being used,
then set the  __`Require a thawing potion tp split`__ option.

If __`Gem Conversion`__ is enabled, 35 recipees are added.
Each recipe takes a single gem and a stamina potion, and returns a different gem of the same rank.
For example, "Flawed Amethyst + Stamina Potion" might give a Flawed Diamond
(and return the Stamina Potion so the recipe can be repeatedly used to cycle through the gem types).
